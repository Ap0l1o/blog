Recently there’s been a lot of renewed interest in landing\non the moon which is very exciting, and also a lot of press coverage of NASA’s\nCommercial Crew programme returning manned spaceflight capability to the United States.</p>\n<p>Between these two advances, there have been many pointing out the decades where\nwe as a society, and the US in particular, were going backwards. The Moon\nlanding was in the 60s, but we stopped going in the 70s, and the US lost the\nability to launch humans into space in 2011 at the end of the Shuttle programme.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There’s a theme in modern software engineering that feels very similar. In 1968,\nDouglas Englebart demoed live collaborative document editing on a computer,\nalongside a video conference session with colleagues in another town. This was\nrevolutionary at the time, in a similar way to the moon landing, but it took us\nuntil 2003 to get Skype and 2005 to get Writely which became Google Docs.</p>\n<p>We have computers that are far faster now than even 10 years ago, and yet they\ndon’t do much more. I regularly see comparisons of feats of software engineering\nfrom decades past compared to the seemingly trivial struggles we have with our\nmodern tooling.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Let’s take a brief diversion to talk about a great new invention that’s going to\ntake the world by storm. It can transport large numbers of people in luxury. No\nmore cramped aeroplanes, here you can have a bed and dine in the onboard\nrestaruant, wander along the promenade. As the cutaway below shows there’s even\nreading room <em>and</em> a writing room.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d711fff6519ea9259a00948bd6590626/35569/airship-cutaway.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 64%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/d711fff6519ea9259a00948bd6590626/2b93a/airship-cutaway.webp 150w,\n/static/d711fff6519ea9259a00948bd6590626/e93cc/airship-cutaway.webp 300w,\n/static/d711fff6519ea9259a00948bd6590626/b0544/airship-cutaway.webp 600w,\n/static/d711fff6519ea9259a00948bd6590626/f2da9/airship-cutaway.webp 880w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/d711fff6519ea9259a00948bd6590626/63ecb/airship-cutaway.jpg 150w,\n/static/d711fff6519ea9259a00948bd6590626/73b64/airship-cutaway.jpg 300w,\n/static/d711fff6519ea9259a00948bd6590626/3ad8d/airship-cutaway.jpg 600w,\n/static/d711fff6519ea9259a00948bd6590626/35569/airship-cutaway.jpg 880w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/d711fff6519ea9259a00948bd6590626/3ad8d/airship-cutaway.jpg\"\n          alt=\"Cutaway of the inside of an airship\"\n          title=\"Cutaway of the inside of an airship\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>But it doesn’t stop there. It can stay aloft for days, is very fuel efficient,\nand the military models could even be equipped with hangers to deploy and\nretrieve their own squadron of smaller planes for defense or reconnaissance.</p>\n<p>This is of course an airship. By many measures airships sound like great idea,\nin the 20s and 30s they were the Next Big Thing. So why did it take us until\naround 2010 to get back to large cabins in the sky on board the luxury Airbus A380?</p>\n<p>Well airships have a fatal flaw, quite literally, in that they use hydrogen for\nlift. Hydrogen in extremely flammable, and airships eventually lost their appeal\nafter many were brought down in flames by the smallest of sparks. Even those\nusing inert helium for lift proved remarkably unsafe. Finally, airships are also\nslow. They could take several days to cross the Atlantic, where a regular\ncommercial jet would take only 6 hours.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>What does this have to do with manned spaceflight or software engineering?\nAirships illustrate the error in the criticism we saw earlier. On paper, airships <em>seem</em> great, or at least much better than what one might think looking\nat the number of airships on the departures board at Heathrow today. But we know\nthey aren’t.</p>\n<p>Manned spaceflight is in a similar position. The Apollo programme ended and we\nlost the capability to get to the moon, but we also ended a programme with a\nnearly 1 in 10 fatality rate, missions that could only send 3 men at a time (and\nthey had to be men), mostly test pilots, who had to measure in a fairly small\nheight range, to the moon on rockets and in spacecraft that weren’t reusable in\nany way.</p>\n<p>We moved on to the Shuttle. A vehicle that could carry 7 astronauts and\nsignificant payloads. The Shuttle was big enough to build the ISS, and deploy\nand maintain the Hubble Space Telescope. It could also be re-used, even if doing\nso cost $1bn and required months of work. 42 women travelled to space on the\nShuttle. But perhaps most importantly of all, the Shuttle proved to have a much\nlower fatality rate, at roughly 1.5%.</p>\n<p>The shuttle programme ended in 2011, and all the focus is on companies like\nSpaceX and Boeing. While there’s still much to be proven by these companies, the\n48 successful landings by SpaceX, and the fact that they are refurbishing and\nre-using Falcon 9 boosters rapidly and for a tiny fraction of the cost suggests\nthat this leap forward could be as impactful as the last.</p>\n<p>How about software engineering? When Douglas Englebart performed his demo in\n1968 it was astounding, and in some ways still is today. But like manned\nspaceflight many things that are less visible have improved significantly in the\nlast 50 years.</p>\n<p>Our computers are far more secure, no longer sharing memory between processes,\nhaving strict separations between operating system and programs. Our networking\nisn’t single point-to-point leased cables as it was in Englebart’s demo, it’s an\ninfinitely configurable high speed network connecting nearly every computer on\nthe planet on-demand at low cost. The “video conferencing” in the demo was also\nnot what we’d consider video conferencing now – it was a TV signal displayed on\ntop of the computer’s output, not passing through the computer at all, whereas\nmodern video conferencing allows us to precisely control our video, and stream\non commodity hardware rather than TV cameras.</p>\n<p>There is waste in modern software, but it’s also far more accessible and\naccomplishing more today than it ever has. High level languages like Python may\nrun far slower than it’s possible to run, but they are accessible enough that\nthey are taught in school at a young age. They might waste our fantastic\ncomputing resources, but they also let us develop software faster than ever before.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It’s easy to say that things aren’t as good as they used to be, and it sounds\ngood in a headline, but when you encounter tidbits like this have a look for\nwhere our standards and requirements have changed.</p>\n<p><em>Are we really going backwards,</em> or are we just unwilling to accept the level of\nquality we had before? <em>Are we really wasting our resources,</em> or are we having a\nfar greater impact than before? <em>Have we really lost something,</em> or have we\nrealised that there are more important things we could be doing that might not\nfit neatly into a headline or sound bite.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/2020-02-17-back-to-the-future/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Requirements change for the better","theme":null,"originally_on_thread":null,"date":"17 February, 2020"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Dan Palmer","description":"Personal site and blog"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-02-17-back-to-the-future/"}}}
