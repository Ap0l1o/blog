I found it\nfascinating how much of the classic image I have of corporate greed stems from\nthe relatively recent collapse of Enron in 2001. Since I just missed the Enron\ncollapse, being about ten years old at the time, I had assumed that these ideas\nhad existed for much longer, but during the bull market of the 90s the image had\nyet to fully form.</p>\n<p>There is too much detail in the book to summarise everything I’ve learned from\nit, but I wanted to pull out two specific pieces that will be front of mind for\nme for a long time to come. I’ve simplified some of the details here partially\nbecause there’s too much in the book to include here, and partially because I’m\nnot familiar enough with the financial concepts to talk about them confidently.\nApologies for any mistakes, but I hope the points still remain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mark-to-market-accounting\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#mark-to-market-accounting\" aria-label=\"mark to market accounting permalink\" class=\"header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Mark to market accounting</h3>\n<p>Something that stood out to me when watching <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TC8CQf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the film</a> (before\nI read the book) was Enron’s use of mark-to-market accounting. This is\nwhere assets and liabilities are valued according to the current market price,\nrather than the price paid or value they have provided.</p>\n<p>The example given with Enron was that when closing a deal they would book the\nentire value of the deal on the balance sheet at the time of signing. For\nexample, if selling a contract to provide energy, worth $1m revenue a year for\n20 years, they would book revenue of $20m at the time of signing. Traditionally\nthis would have been booked as $1m each year of the contract. This practice\nlooked great at first glance as Enron was booking significant revenues, and\ncould show huge growth. The market and analysts loved this and it was reflected\nin their share price from the mid-90s until not long before their collapse.</p>\n<p>When watching the film I had thought this whole practice sounded ridiculous;\n<em>well obviously they must be a fraud</em> I had thought. However the book goes into\nmore detail…</p>\n<p>Imagine a hedge fund. When buying a stake in a company on the stock market for\n$20m, that is worth exactly that at the time of buying. Recording it on the\nbalance sheet as such is an accurate way to document the value now owned by the\nhedge fund. If the share price goes up by 10%, the hedge fund could book revenue\nof another $2m, because the value of their stake is now worth $22m. The flip\nside is that if the share price drops by 10%, they should book a loss of $2m as\ntheir stake is now only worth $18m.</p>\n<p>This is fairly intuitive and easy to understand, and that’s\n(roughly) mark-to-market accounting. This is in fact so well understood\nthat it’s considered a normal part of the Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (GAAP) in the US, a common set of practices for how to document\naccounting for investors, auditors, or the public.</p>\n<p>Now imagine that this hedge fund traded energy futures instead of shares, but\nthat we’re in the mid 90s so there isn’t a market for energy futures yet, and\nthe hedge fund is trying to start a market for them. One could argue that this\nisn’t a materially different scenario, and indeed that’s what Enron’s position\nwas. While they started out as strictly an energy company, owning gas pipelines\nand production facilities, they wanted to transform into a “gas bank” – creating\na market for natural gas contracts that could be traded, to hedge and securitise\nenergy services. This was so critical to Jeff Skilling’s vision for Enron when\nhe joined, that he negotiated his employment contract to include a requirement\nfor Enron to move to mark-to-market accounting so that they could work more like\na financial institution than a traditional energy company.</p>\n<p>Before reading the book, I hadn’t appreciated how close to reasonable the choice\nof mark-to-market accounting was. In many ways it really did make sense,\nespecially since Enron was creating something new.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Enron (and their accountants Arthur Anderson) with hindsight\nit wasn’t the right choice. Mark-to-market accounting works for shares and might\nbe fine for energy futures, but much of Enron’s business was still traditional\nenergy supply contracts where the practice didn’t make sense. Also\nmark-to-market requires the ongoing updating of the value of assets and\nliabilities over time, based on an accurate understanding of value. In many\ncases, Enron did not update their balance sheet with the new values of their\ncontracts, and even when they did this was typically done with optimistic models\nand forecasts created internally with no oversight, rather a stock market value\nthat a hedge fund would typically use.</p>\n<p>This theme of Enron’s innovation being mostly reasonable on the surface\ncontinues throughout the book, however one of the main reason’s for their\ndownfall was Enron’s culture of legality being equated to ethics – if it’s\nlegal, it’s <em>right</em>. Ultimately Enron did a lot that was illegal, but much of\ntheir fate was sealed with legal actions (and those that weren’t sufficiently\nchallenged by their risk team, accountants, or the SEC), that they believed were\nright to do.</p>\n<p>There are many parallels with the present-day themes of <em>disruption</em> in Silicon\nValley and the tech ecosystem, but in place of financial engineering run amok we\nsee privacy/targeting and exploitation of workers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"doubling-down-on-failure\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#doubling-down-on-failure\" aria-label=\"doubling down on failure permalink\" class=\"header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Doubling down on failure</h3>\n<p>The second thing that stood out to me while reading the book was how throughout\ntheir history, even in their final months and days, Enron and their senior staff\ndoubled down on errors of judgement further leveraging themselves and\nexacerbating their precarious position.</p>\n<p>The main example of this is how Enron CFO Andy Fastow created multiple funds\n(each larger than the one before) that lent to Enron, with investment repayments\nguaranteed by Enron. Not only did Enron guarantee to repay the loans immediately\nshould their credit rating be downgraded, but returns were also guaranteed\nby Enron shares, meaning if the share price fell to far, it would cost Enron\nfar more shares to repay them. The worst part was that these two mechanisms –\nshare price and credit rating – are intrinsically linked (both being proxies for\nconfidence) such that should one go bad, it would be very likely that the other\none would as well.</p>\n<p>This all happened because of a culture that Enron executives may have called\noptimistic, but that many would have called arrogant. Arthur Anderson\naccountants and other Enron clients both spoke to this culture of arrogance – a\nfeeling that Enron employees were better than everyone else.</p>\n<p>It seems that much of this arrogance came from Jeff Skilling who had\npreviously been a partner at the management consultancy McKinsey &#x26; Company.\nMcKinsey already have a reputation for elitism, and arguably arrogance (although\nin my limited experience they seem good at what they do), so combined with\nSkilling’s own meteoric rise through their ranks it’s not surprising that this\nwas amplified at Enron.</p>\n<p>It’s also not surprising in hindsight that Skilling’s own sense of self-worth\nbecame entangled with Enron’s share price to the point where he ultimately left\ndue to its decline and then attempted to re-join as he realised that the decline\nmay not have been his doing after all (it definitely was).</p>\n<p>For me, the most egregious example of the arrogance in Enron’s culture came from\nCEO Ken Lay, who had much of his extensive personal wealth tied to Enron in the\nform of shares, loans, and future bonuses. So much of his wealth was tied to it\nthat his financial advisors encouraged him to diversify, but rather than selling\nEnron shares and putting the money into other investments he took out loans for\ninvestments that were secured against the value of his Enron shares. This\nleverage was yet another dangerous link to a share price based on artificially\ninflated numbers, and another example of a cultural belief that Enron was\nspecial and could not fail.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, one of the messages I ended up taking away from the book was that\nnot only was Enron’s culture a toxic and unpleasant one that reduced their\neffectiveness as a company, but the arrogance in their culture and approach\nbeing the best way to do things led to them doubling down on the worst aspects\nduring their toughest times.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For anyone interested in or working in finance, I’d recommend <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36crEBw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em>Enron: The\nSmartest Guys in the Room</em></a> as a detailed study in how not to\noperate, and common ethical pitfalls to avoid. For anyone interested in company\nculture and how it affects performance, it’s a fascinating read, documenting one\nof the clearest examples of that connection that I know of.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/2020-01-14-enron/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room","theme":"enron","originally_on_thread":null,"date":"14 January, 2020"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Dan Palmer","description":"Personal site and blog"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-01-14-enron/"}}}
