I concluded that <a href=\"http://izettle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">iZettle</a>, a startup from Sweden, was well poised to take the European market, but maybe that’s not an issue for Square?</p>\n<p>In my previous article I passed over <a href=\"https://squareup.com/wallet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Square Wallet</a> — previously ‘Pay with Square’ — without much of a mention, but this summer I met up with former Square employee Louis Mantia and he pointed out that it isn’t just a neat feature of Square, it’s the whole point.</p>\n<p>While Square happens to have a useful way of accepting card payments, this isn’t important, and the technology that they use certainly isn’t as important as I thought it was. Square would prefer it if you never had to take your card out, they want to make the whole process seamless, and that’s not tied to a country or a technology.</p>\n<p>PayPal and iZettle saw Square’s first move and jumped to copy it, but possibly without realising that it was only a stepping stone on the route to eliminating card payments all together. With Square now in <a href=\"https://squareup.com/news/releases/2012/starbucks-offers-square-wallet-beginning-today\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Starbucks</a>, and with the <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/with-new-hardware-square-begins-taxi-rollout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">trial in New York taxis</a> this year, it’s obvious they are after bigger businesses, and if they manage it could change everything about how we perceive payments.</p>\n<p>As Square redefines the payment process, PayPal Here and iZettle remain very much just a way to take card payments on a mobile device. I’m going to tentatively predict that Square will expand to the UK in 2013, and I think we might see even more emphasis on the Wallet when we do with less emphasis on individuals taking payments.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/2012-12-30-squares-advantage/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Square's Advantage","theme":null,"originally_on_thread":null,"date":"30 December, 2012"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Dan Palmer","description":"Personal site and blog"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2012-12-30-squares-advantage/"}}}
